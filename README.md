# Text-classification-of-movie-reviews
In this repository, the performance of two classifiers is investigated. The first classifier is the Naive Bayes classifer which can be constructed using NLTK 
while the second classifier is a word list classifier that is built from scratch. Both classifiers were compared on movie reviews dataset 
and the aim here is to classify if the review is positive or negative.
